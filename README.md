eDEX-UI is a fullscreen, cross-platform terminal emulator and system monitor that looks and feels like a sci-fi computer interface.

Heavily inspired from the [TRON Legacy movie effects](https://web.archive.org/web/20170511000410/http://jtnimoy.com/blogs/projects/14881671), the eDEX-UI project was originally meant to be *"[DEX-UI](https://github.com/seenaburns/dex-ui) with less Â« art Â» and more Â« distributable software Â»"*. While keeping a futuristic look and feel, it strives to maintain a certain level of functionality and to be usable in real-life scenarios, with the larger goal of bringing science-fiction UXs to the mainstream.

It might or might not be a joke taken too seriously.

## Q&A
#### Where can I find download links?
Click on the little badges under the eDEX logo at the top of this page, or go to the [Releases](https://github.com/GitSquared/edex-ui/releases) tab.
#### I have a problem!
Search through the [Issues](https://github.com/GitSquared/edex-ui/issues) to see if yours has already been reported. If you're confident it hasn't been reported yet, feel free to open up a new one. If you see your issue and it's been closed, it probably means that the fix for it will ship in the next version, and you'll have to wait a bit.
#### Can you disable the keyboard/the filesystem display?
You can't disable them (yet) but you can hide them. See the `tron-notype` theme.Thank you for supporting ðŸŽ‰ SAILLARD Gabriel
#### Are PRs welcome?
They are!
#### Is this repo actively maintained?
![Yes.](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/GitSquared/edex-ui.svg?style=popout)
#### How did you make this?
Glad you're interested! See #272.
#### This is so cool.
Thanks!

## Useful commands for the nerds
#### Starting from source:

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** the following instructions are meant **for DEVELOPERS ONLY**. If you're just a casual user please download the precompiled binaries available on the [Releases tab](https://github.com/GitSquared/edex-ui/releases).

on *nix systems (You'll need the Xcode command line tools on macOS):
- clone the repository
- `npm run install-linux`
- `npm start`

on Windows:
- start cmd or powershell **as administrator**
- clone the repository
- `npm run install-windows`
- `npm start`
#### Building
Note: Due to native modules, you can only compile binaries for the OS you are compiling from.
NoteÂ²: It is recommended to start building from a fresh clone to prevent the code minifier script from parsing an entire `node_modules` folder.

- make a fresh clone (recommended)
- `npm install` (NOT `install-linux` or `install-windows`)
- `npm run build-linux` or `build-windows` or `build-darwin`

Resulting binaries and assets will be in the `dist` folder.

## Credits
eDEX-UI's source code was primarily written by me, [Squared](https://github.com/GitSquared). If you want to get in touch with me or find other projects I'm involved in, check out [my website](https://squared.codebrew.fr).

[PixelyIon](https://github.com/PixelyIon) helped me get started with Windows compatibility and offered some precious advice when I started to work on this project seriously.

## Thanks
Of course, eDEX would never have existed if I hadn't stumbled upon the amazing work of [Seena](https://github.com/seenaburns) on [r/unixporn](https://reddit.com/r/unixporn).

This project uses a bunch of open-source libraries, frameworks and tools, see [the full dependency graph](https://github.com/GitSquared/edex-ui/network/dependencies).

I want to namely thank the developers behind [xterm.js](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js), [systeminformation](https://github.com/sebhildebrandt/systeminformation) and [SmoothieCharts](https://github.com/joewalnes/smoothie).

Huge thanks to [Rob "Arscan" Scanlon](https://github.com/arscan) for making the fantastic [ENCOM Globe](https://github.com/arscan/encom-globe), also inspired by the TRON: Legacy movie, and distributing it freely. His work really puts the icing on the cake.
